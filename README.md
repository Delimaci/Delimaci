## Hello there!

I'm Gabi, a software engineer and Sims 4 modder.

I currently work as a software engineer in healthcare, where I create secure data-driven pipelines, automation, dashboards and solutions.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the latest in science and technology. I create Sims 4 mods, experiment with cybersecurity projects, and play video games.
